```


Read and clean applicable data, modify pols_month data so that the column reads date and round down the days to the first of the month. 

```{r results = "hide"}
gdp = read_csv("./GDP.csv") %>%
  clean_names()

pols_month = read_csv("./pols-month.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(mon = as.Date(mon, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::floor_date(mon, "month")) %>%
  select(-mon)
```


The two datasets can then be merged by date. 

```{r}

pol_data = merge(gdp, pols_month, by = "date")
```
